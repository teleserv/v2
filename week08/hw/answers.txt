I know annotaiton of large image are currently outsourced to Chinese rural villages due to the computer resources and cheap labor. I wouldn't think of a better way so far..

4. Think about image augmentation? How would augmentations such as flip,

more training samples but less presicion in predictions due to the change of scale and pixels.
